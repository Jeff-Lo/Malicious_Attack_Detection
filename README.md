# Malicious Attack Detection

## Background
This is a project for implementing malicious attack detection via Autoencoder, Neural Network Model, and Machine Learning. We would like to detect malicious attacks from network packets. Our goal is to use our trained model to classify an incoming packet to be benign or malicious.

## Develop Environment
* **Environment:** Colab
* **Language:** Python
* **Dataset:** NF-UNSW-NB15-V2.csv, NF-UNSW-NB15-V2.parquet
* **AutoEncoder Model:** model.h5
* **Usage:** See Malicious_Attack_Detection.ipynb for more details
